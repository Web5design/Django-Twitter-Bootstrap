{"name":"Django-twitter-bootstrap","body":"Django Twitter Bootstrap\r\n=========================\r\nThe goal of Django Twitter Bootstrap is quite simple - provide a base Django project which handles the build process of Twitter Bootstrap 2.0 via django-compress.  Basically, using this template, it will be easy to see how you can include more LESS files (and even coffeescript) and have Django build (and with DEBUG = False, concat and compress) these files for production use.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\nYou must have lessc and node globally accessible. On OSX, I used Macports to install node, added a symbolic link to /usr/bin/node and then used Node Package Manager (npm) to install lessc via the following:\r\n    \r\n    npm install --global less\r\n\r\nIf you can run the test pages (no syncdb required), then you're golden.\r\n\r\nUpdates\r\n-------\r\nI will keep an eye on Twitter Bootstrap and update my code as necessary. If I'm behind, let me know!\r\n\r\nI Need Help With...\r\n--------------------\r\nI would love for someone to help me standardize this project a little further. Ideally without too many more requirements, better logging and media support would be great settings for a starter project like this!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","tagline":"A Django template leveraging Twitter Bootstrap 2.0 and runtime building/compression.
